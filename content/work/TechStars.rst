:description: Hired gun for the worlds best incubator

I was hired by `TechStars <http://techstars.com>`_ to be a `HackStar <http://techstars.com/hackstars>`_

Working for TechStars I did a lot of amazing work including building some internal tools that are still used today to help their business processes.

To use the words of TechStars to describe my work for them:

 * I am a code-slinging mac-daddy superstar guru at PHP, Java, Python, Objective-C, Ruby, and JQuery.
 * I can design, cut and code efficiently and brilliantly
 * I was vital in the assistance of some of the countryâ€™s most promising new founders and young companies.
