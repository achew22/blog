:description: Provided next generation digital signage

Working for `Kiltish <http://kiltish.com>`_ in association with `Lucky Charm Productions <http://luckycharmproductions.com>`_, I created an app that provides marquee and showtime information to visitors at movie venues, concert halls, restaurants and anywhere else digital signage is used. The app is called `Bright Display <http://luckycharmproductions.com/brightdisplay>`_ The app was developed for Google TV that allows them to replace their entire fleet of Mac Mini computers saving the company thousands of dollars per deployment.

Take a `look <http://luckycharmproductions.com/what-we-do/media-system>`_ at my work in action.
