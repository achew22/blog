:web_description: Provided next generation digital signage
:description: For `Kiltish <http://kiltish.com>`_ in association with `Lucky Charm Productions <http://luckycharmproductions.com>`_, I created a Google TV app that provides marquee and showtime information to visitors at movie venues, concert halls, restaurants and anywhere else digital signage is used. The app, `Bright Display <http://luckycharmproductions.com/brightdisplay>`_, was developed for Google TV and allowed a movie theater company to replace their entire fleet of Mac Mini computers, saving the company thousands of dollars per deployment.
